# fruitScraper
Prerequisite:
Java 8+
Maven 3+

To compile the solution: 
Go to the project folder and run mvn clean compile assembly:single

To run the solution:
Go to "projectFolder"/target and execute the jar with java -jar "jarName"
It should be sometihng like "java -jar fruitScraper-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar"
The result will be displayed in the console.


For the purpose of the demo, I only tested the service itself, but obviously
the adaptors and helpers should have their own unit test.
